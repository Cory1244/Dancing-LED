# TFYA65-Spectrum-Analyzer-
Modified version of naztronaut / dancyPi-audio-reactive-led.
The main structure of this project is written by Naztroaunt. What has been done is 
added code to make it able to display a spectrum analyzer on a 2d grid of adressable RGBs.

To replicate this project I would recommend to follow the documentation provided by Naztronaut then
replace config.py and vizualisation.py with our version. Be sure to read the config file and change it
according to your hardware
